# Agent Instructions

- If you are implementing a new feature, add new playwright tests for that feature.
- Before you declare a task complete:
    - Build the project: `npm run build`
    - Run all tests: `npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium`
- If any failures are detected, investigate and fix the issues.
